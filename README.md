## Reflection

### What went well:
- Coding: The coding process was smooth and enjoyable, making it a great experience overall.
- Creating a game:  Initially, I thought making the game would be much harder and couldn't fully imagine how it would come together, but it turned out to be manageable and rewarding.

### Challenges:
- Drawing: I am not the best in drawing so it was hard for me to focus on that part
  
### Lessons Learned:
- Design part: Don't overthink what you draw just try it and you will see if it looks good
